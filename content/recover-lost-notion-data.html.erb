  Recovering Your Lost Notion Data
</h1>

<p class="mt-6 text-base text-gray-600 text-center">Updated: <time datetime="<%= item[:updated_at] %>">October 3, 2023</time></p>

<p class="mt-8">Data loss is terrible, especially when it involves valuable information you've meticulously organized on Notion. It could be a single page, a database, or your entire workspace that has gone missing.</p>

<p class="mt-8">Notion stores user data in the US data centers managed by Amazon Web Services (AWS), one of the leading cloud service providers worldwide. While Notion does keep backups of your data, in rare instances data might go missing.</p>

<p class="mt-8">This guide will provide you with a variety of solutions to recover your lost data.</p>

<h2 class="my-8">Finding deleted pages</h2>

<p class="mt-8">The first step when you notice that a page is missing is to check the Trash. Notion automatically moves deleted pages to the Trash, acting as an archive that you can recover from.</p>

<p class="mt-8">You can find the <a href="https://www.notion.so/help/duplicate-delete-and-restore-content#find-pages-in-trash" class="underline" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trash</a> in the left-hand sidebar of your workspace. Deleted pages stay in Trash indefinitely until you explicitly delete them.</p>

<h2 class="my-8">Reverting back page changes</h2>

<p class="mt-8">Another feature Notion provides to help recover lost data is the Page History. Notion saves your data automatically, creating per-minute backups of your page content on their server. This allows you to view and revert to previous versions of a page for up to 7 days on the free plan (longer on paid plans). It can come in handy when you've accidentally deleted a part of a page or made changes that you want to undo.</p>

<p class="mt-8">To access the <a href="https://www.notion.so/help/duplicate-delete-and-restore-content#page-history" class="underline" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Page History</a>, open the page you want to restore, click on the Updates icon or "..." in the upper-right corner, and select Page History. A sidebar will appear, displaying the different versions of your page.</p>

<h2 class="my-8">Recovering permanently deleted items</h2>

<p class="mt-8">If you've deleted a page from the Trash, it's gone from your account.</p>

<p class="mt-8">However, you can still recover it by <a href="https://www.notion.so/help" class="underline" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contacting Notion</a>; your data could be restored for up to 30 days after deletion.</p>

<h2 class="my-8">Missing workspace</h2>

<p class="mt-8">If you can't access your workspace at all, or you've accidentally deleted it, reach out to <a href="https://www.notion.so/help" class="underline" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Notion's support</a> as soon as possible.</p>

<p class="mt-8">Sometimes, workspaces could go missing without any fault of your own.</p>

<h2 class="my-8">Extracting backups</h2>

<p class="mt-8">Notion exports backups in zip format. If you're getting the "The compressed (zipped) folder is invalid" error message with Windows' default archive extractor, consider using <a href="https://7-zip.org" class="underline" target="_blank" rel="noopener">7zip</a> instead.</p>

<h2 class="my-8">Making regular backups</h2>

<p class="mt-8">It's a good idea to regularly make backups of your workspace.</p>

<p class="mt-8">You can <a href="https://www.notion.so/help/export-your-content" class="underline" target="_blank" rel="noopener">export your content</a> in Markdown/CSV, HTML, and PDF formats from your workspace settings.</p>

<p class="mt-8">Another way of making regular backups is to use <a href="https://notionbackups.com" class="underline">Notion Backups</a>, so you won't have to manually export and manage your backups.</p>
