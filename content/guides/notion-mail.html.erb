  <h2 class="my-8">What Are Users Saying?</h2>

  <p class="mt-8">Notion Mail's beta has sparked plenty of chatter, and feedback is a mixed bag.

  <p class="mt-8">Some users are all in—one X user raved, <a href="https://x.com/yask123/status/1900670172983074899" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="underline">"Notion Mail fixed emails for me. I'd been waiting for something like this since Google killed Inbox."</a></p>

  <p class="mt-8">But it's not all smooth sailing. A Reddit commenter pointed out, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Notion/comments/1gd7we2/new_notion_mail_automation_is_not_as_good_as_i/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="underline">"The automations don't let me send an email to a linked client from my clients database… rendering it pretty much useless for freelancers like me."</a></p>

  <p class="mt-8">Since it's still in beta, hiccups are expected. The <a href="https://x.com/NotionMail/status/1902150793572315485" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="underline">@NotionMail</a> team is already sharing updates on fixes, so things should improve as the kinks get ironed out.</p>

  <h2 class="my-8">Future Outlook: Where It Falls Short (For Now)</h2>

  <p class="mt-8">Notion Mail isn't perfect yet—here are the main limitations to know about:</p>

  <ul class="mt-8 text-xl text-gray-700 leading-8">
    <li class="mt-2"><strong>Gmail Only</strong>: Right now, it only supports Gmail accounts. If you're on Outlook or another provider, you'll need to sit tight for broader compatibility.</li>
    <li class="mt-2"><strong>Speed Bumps</strong>: Some users have noticed lag, though Notion's team is on the case to boost performance.</li>
    <li class="mt-2"><strong>Web-Only Access</strong>: You're limited to using it on the web — no mobile or desktop apps yet.</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="mt-8">These are typical growing pains for a beta release.</p>

  <h2 class="my-8">What's Coming Down the Line?</h2>

  <p class="mt-8">Notion's known for refining its tools based on what users need. Here's what we might see in Notion Mail's future:</p>

  <ul class="mt-8 text-xl text-gray-700 leading-8">
    <li class="mt-2"><strong>More Email Providers</strong>: Gmail's just the start — support for Outlook and others could be next.</li>
    <li class="mt-2"><strong>Faster Performance</strong>: Speed tweaks are already in progress, promising a snappier experience soon.</li>
    <li class="mt-2"><strong>Smarter Automations</strong>: Expect more powerful options, like sending emails to linked contacts or auto-attaching files.</li>
    <li class="mt-2"><strong>Full App Support</strong>: Mobile and desktop apps would make Notion Mail a true inbox companion.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="my-8">Should You Give Notion Mail a Shot?</h2>

  <p class="mt-8">Notion Mail could be a game-changer for Notion users drowning in email. It's still early days, and there are rough edges, but its fresh approach and Notion's knack for improvement make it worth watching.
