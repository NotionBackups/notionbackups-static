<h2 class="my-8">What Exactly Is Notion Mail?</h2>

<p class="mt-8 mb-8">In short, it's just a wrapper around your Gmail inbox. It's an email client that connects to your Gmail and lets you manage your emails in Notion.</p>

<h2 class="my-8">How it differs from Gmail?</h2>

<p class="mt-8 mb-8">Gmail is the email service that lets you send and receive emails. It stands on its own. Notion Mail is a client that acts as an interface to your Gmail. If Gmail's servers are down, Notion Mail won't be able to send or receive emails.</p>

  <h2 class="my-8">What’s Notion Mail Bringing to the Table?</h2>

  <p class="mt-8">So, what’s the big deal with Notion Mail? It’s all about making email play nice with the rest of your Notion setup. You can tweak your inbox to look and feel like a Notion page — think custom views sorted by project or deadline.

  <p class="mt-8">Then there’s the AI angle: Notion’s AI can sort your emails, draft quick replies, or even archive stuff you don’t need to deal with. It’s like having a sidekick who’s obsessed with keeping your inbox tidy.</p>

  <p class="mt-8">Notion Mail hooks up with <a href="https://www.notion.com/product/calendar" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="underline">Notion Calendar</a>, so you can schedule meetings right from an email without bouncing between apps. You can also save emails as snippets in your Notion workspace. It’s not about doing everything Gmail can’t — it’s about doing it in a way that fits your workflow.</p>

  <h2 class="my-8">What Are Users Saying?</h2>

  <p class="mt-8">The feedack is mixed so far.</p>

  <p class="mt-8">Some users are all in — one X user raved, <a href="https://x.com/yask123/status/1900670172983074899" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="underline">"Notion Mail fixed emails for me. I'd been waiting for something like this since Google killed Inbox."</a></p>

  <p class="mt-8">But it's not all smooth sailing. A Reddit commenter pointed out, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Notion/comments/1gd7we2/new_notion_mail_automation_is_not_as_good_as_i/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="underline">"The automations don't let me send an email to a linked client from my clients database… rendering it pretty much useless for freelancers like me."</a></p>

  <p class="mt-8">Since it's still in beta, hiccups are expected. The <a href="https://x.com/NotionMail/status/1902150793572315485" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="underline">@NotionMail</a> team is already sharing updates on fixes, so things should improve as the kinks get ironed out.</p>

  <h2 class="my-8">Future Outlook: Where It Falls Short (For Now)</h2>

  <ul class="mt-8 text-xl text-gray-700 leading-8">
    <li class="mt-2"><strong>Gmail Only</strong>: Right now, it only supports Gmail accounts. If you're on Outlook or another provider, you'll need to sit tight for broader compatibility.</li>
    <li class="mt-2"><strong>Laggy UI/UX</strong>: Some users have noticed lag.</li>
    <li class="mt-2"><strong>Web-Only Access</strong>: You're limited to using it on the web — no mobile or desktop apps yet.</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="mt-8">These are typical growing pains for a beta release.</p>

  <h2 class="my-8">Should You Give Notion Mail a Shot?</h2>

  <p class="mt-8">The real kicker is that Notion Mail feels built for people who already live in Notion. If that’s not you, it’s probably not worth the switch — Gmail’s totally fine.</p>
