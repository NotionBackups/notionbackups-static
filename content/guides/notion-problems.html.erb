    Troubleshooting Notion errors
  </h1>

  <p class="mt-8">Below we've compiled some of the common issues with Notion and ways of fixing them.</p>

  <h2 class="my-8">Template won't duplicate</h2>

  <p class="mt-8">What’s happening: It’s often a temporary glitch or a permissions problem inside the template’s nested pages (usually databases). Fixes:</p>

  <ul class="mt-8 text-xl text-gray-700 leading-8">
    <li class="mt-4">Try duplicating from the mobile app - it often bypasses the hiccup.</li>
    <li class="mt-4">Check sharing on every page and database inside the template. If a sub-page has stricter permissions, duplication can fail even if the top page is shared. Explicitly share all nested pages/databases, not just the parent. Make sure the share chain doesn’t stop where permissions change.</li>
    <li class="mt-4">If all else fails, wait a bit and try again - this is a known issue on Notion’s side.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="my-8">Notion won’t load at all</h2>

  <p class="mt-8">What’s happening: Network/DNS issues or a glitch in the desktop app. Fixes:</p>

  <ul class="mt-8 text-xl text-gray-700 leading-8">
    <li class="mt-4">Switch your DNS to 8.8.8.8 (Google DNS) or 1.1.1.1 (Cloudflare). Some networks block Notion at the DNS level.</li>
    <li class="mt-4">Desktop app → View → Force Reload. This clears cached junk without a full reinstall.</li>
    <li class="mt-4">If the web app loads but the desktop app doesn’t, reinstall the desktop app. (You’ll keep your data—it lives in the cloud.)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="my-8">Export fails</h2>

  <p class="mt-8">What’s happening: Big workspaces take time; the export job can stall. Fixes:</p>

  <ul class="mt-8 text-xl text-gray-700 leading-8">
    <li class="mt-4">Try again. For large exports, give it time - Notion processes in the background.</li>
    <li class="mt-4">If the ZIP won’t open, use 7-Zip to extract—more forgiving than default tools.</li>
    <li class="mt-4">PDF export caveats: Expect layout quirks—page breaks, wide tables, toggles, code blocks, and embeds don’t always render cleanly. Inline images can shift; complex databases flatten. For share-ready PDFs, you may need manual cleanup.</li>
  </ul>
