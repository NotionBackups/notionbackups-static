  <h2 class="my-8">Backup folder</h2>

  <p class="mt-8">By default, your backups will be stored in a top-level folder called "Notion Backups". You can safely rename that folder and nest it under other folders.</p>

  <p class="mt-8">If you delete that folder, a new one will be created in its place.</p>

  <p class="mt-8">Renaming individual backup files may prevent you from restoring your workspace from them.</p>

  <h2 class="my-8">Security</h2>

  <p class="mt-8">Google Drive integration doesn't have access to any other folders or files in your account except the ones it has created. If you move other files to this folder, they won't be accessible to the integration.</p>

  <p class="mt-8">Disconnecting your Google Drive account from the dashboard prevents Notion Backups from accessing your Google Drive account in the future (you can always reauthorize later). Similarly, deleting your Notion Backups account automatically revokes access to your Google Drive account.</p>

  <p class="mt-8">If you have questions about anything, feel free to <a href="mailto:support@notionbackups.com" class="underline">reach out</a>.</p>
