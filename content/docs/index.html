  <p class="mt-8">Welcome to Notion Backups' docs!</p>

  <p class="mt-8">If you have questions about anything, feel free to <a href="mailto:support@notionbackups.com" class="underline">reach out</a>.</p>

  <h2 class="my-8">Pages</h2>

  <p class="mt-8">Notion Backups only has access to Notion pages you have explicitly authorized. Pages created after the authorization won't be backed up. If you want to change page access after creating a workspace, you can do so in the workspace settings.</p>

  <h2 class="my-8">Cloud storage providers</h2>

  <p class="mt-8">You need to connect at least one of the available cloud storage providers to get your workspace backed up. Currently, you can store your backups in Google Drive, Dropbox, and Amazon S3 buckets.</p>

  <p class="mt-8">Google Drive and Dropbox integrations do not have access to any other folder (or file) in your account except the folder they upload backups to. With Amazon S3, you can restrict your key's access to specific buckets only (see below).</p>

  <p class="mt-8">When you disconnect Google Drive or Dropbox integrations, your tokens get revoked, and Notion Backups loses access to your accounts. When you delete your account, tokens for Google Drive and Dropbox are revoked automatically for you.</p>

  <h3 class="my-8" id="amazon-s3">Amazon S3</h3>

  <p class="mt-8">To let Notion Backups connect to your S3 bucket, attach the <em>AmazonS3FullAccess</em> policy to your IAM user. It's better to create a new user with only this policy attached to keep your AWS account secure.</p>

  <p class="mt-8">To create a new IAM user:</p>

  <ol class="mt-8 text-xl text-gray-700 leading-8">
     <li>Visit the <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/iamv2/home?#/users" class="underline" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Users page</a> in your IAM dashboard</li>
     <li>Come up with a user name and select the "Access key" option as a credential type <img loading="lazy" class="block my-4 rounded-md shadow" src="/assets/images/add-iam-user-aws.png" alt="Creating a new user in the AWS IAM"></li>
     <li>Select the "Attach existing policies directly" tab and search for the "AmazonS3FullAccess" policy<img loading="lazy" class="block my-4 rounded-md shadow" src="/assets/images/amazon-s3-policy-iam.png" alt="Attaching a policy to the IAM user"></li>
     <li>After creating a user, you can use newly-generated Access Key ID and Secret Access Key in Notion Backups <img loading="lazy" class="block my-4 rounded-md shadow" src="/assets/images/final-iam-screen.png" alt="Final screen summarizing IAM user's attributes"></li>
  </ol>

  <p class="mt-8">Keep in mind that this newly-created IAM user will have access to all your S3 buckets. To restrict access to a specific bucket only, you can <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_examples_s3_deny-except-bucket.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">add the following policy</a>.</p>

  <p class="mt-8">If you're creating an IAM user programmatically, you can use the following policy (replace <code>yourbucket</code> with your bucket's name):</p>

  <pre><code>
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [{
        "Sid": "GrantFullAccessToThisS3Bucket",
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Action": ["s3:*"],
        "Resource": [
            "arn:aws:s3:::<em>yourbucket</em>",
            "arn:aws:s3:::<em>yourbucket</em>/*"
        ]
    }]
}</code></pre>

  <h2 class="my-8" id="restore">Restore</h2>

  <p class="mt-8">Before you can restore your workspace content, your workspace needs to be backed up at least once.</p>

  <p class="mt-8">As of now, the restore functionality works by overwriting some of your Notion content, namely:</p>

  <ul class="mt-8 text-xl text-gray-700 leading-8">
    <li>Page properties, like cover, icon, or title</li>
    <li>Updated database/page/block content that was changed since the last backup</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="mt-8">What restore functionality won't do:</p>

  <ul class="mt-8 text-xl text-gray-700 leading-8">
    <li>Remove or override newly added data</li>
    <li>Restore files/media uploaded to Notion (unsupported by Notion's API)</li>
    <li>Restore archived pages (in Trash)</li>
    <li>Restore comments</li>
    <li>Restore data that wasn't backed up</li>
    <li>Restore deleted data (this is in the works)</li>
  </ul>
