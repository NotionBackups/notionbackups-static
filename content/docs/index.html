  <p class="mt-8">Welcome to Notion Backups' docs!</p>

  <p class="mt-8">You can find more information about Notion Backups' functionality on the following pages:</p>

  <ul class="mt-8 text-xl">
    <li><a href="/docs/backups.html" class="underline">Which data gets backed up</a></li>
    <li><a href="/docs/amazon-s3.html" class="underline">Setting up your AWS S3 bucket</a></li>
    <li><a href="/docs/restore.html" class="underline">Restoring your workspace</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="my-8">Cloud storage providers</h2>

  <p class="mt-8">You need to connect at least one of the available cloud storage providers to get your workspace backed up. Currently, you can store your backups in Google Drive, Dropbox, and <a href="/docs/amazon-s3.html" class="underline">Amazon S3</a> buckets.</p>

  <p class="mt-8">Google Drive and Dropbox integrations do not have access to any other folder (or file) in your account except the folder they upload backups to. With <a href="/docs/amazon-s3.html" class="underline">Amazon S3</a>, you can restrict your key's access to specific buckets only.</p>

  <p class="mt-8">When you disconnect Google Drive or Dropbox integrations, your tokens get revoked, and Notion Backups loses access to your accounts. When you delete your account, tokens for Google Drive and Dropbox are revoked automatically for you.</p>

  <p class="mt-8">If you have questions about anything, feel free to <a href="mailto:support@notionbackups.com" class="underline">reach out</a>.</p>
