    Restoring your Notion workspace
  </h1>

  <p class="mt-8">Before you can restore your workspace, it needs to be backed up at least once. To make sure that the restore process goes as smoothly as possible, <a href="/docs/backups.html#top-level-pages" class="underline" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reauthorize your workspace</a> from the workspace settings and include all the pages you want to back up.</p>

  <h2 class="my-8">Limitations</h2>

  <p class="mt-8">There are some limitations imposed by Notion's API, which make a complete restore impossible at this moment. Some of the current limitations are:</p>

  <ul class="text-xl text-gray-700 leading-8 m-4">
    <li class="p-1">Top-level pages should be nested under another page</li>
    <li class="p-1">Not all block types are supported</li>
    <li class="p-1">Property types such as Rollup, Created by, Created time, Last edited by, or Last edited time can't be restored accurately</li>
    <li class="p-1"><a href="/docs/backups.html#media-files" target="_blank" class="underline">Media files</a> can't be uploaded</li>
    <li class="p-1">Database views don't get restored</li>
    <li class="p-1">Embed blocks don't render fully</li>
    <li class="p-1">The order of blocks might not always be preserved</li>
    <li class="p-1">Comments will carry the integration's name and won't have accurate timestamps</li>
  </ul>
