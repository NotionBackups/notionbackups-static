      Two-factor authentication (2FA)
    </h1>

    <p class="mt-8">Two-factor authentication (2FA) enhances your account's security by requiring a password and a temporary token, adding an extra layer of protection.</p>

    <h2 class="my-8">Setup</h2>

    <p class="mt-8">Notion Backups uses a software-based Time-Based One-Time Password (TOTP) for 2FA. This method generates a temporary six-digit code every 30 seconds for login verification. There are many authenticator apps with this capability, such as Google Authenticator, Authy, Microsoft Authenticator, and LastPass Authenticator.</p>

    <p class="mt-8">You can enable 2FA for your account from your profile settings, by scanning the QR code with one of those  applications and entering the code on the setup page.</p>

    <p class="mt-8">Once set up, you will need to enter the temporary code on each login.</p>

    <h2 class="my-8">Backup code</h2>

    <p class="mt-8">Upon setting up 2FA, you'll receive a backup code; store it somewhere safe. If you lose access to your authenticator app, you can use the backup code to regain access to your account.</p>

    <p class="mt-8">If you have questions about two-factor authentication or can't log in to your account, please <a href="/support.html" class="underline">reach out</a>.</p>
