      Dropbox
    </h1>

    <p class="mt-8">To back up your Notion workspace to Dropbox, connect Notion and authorize access to your Dropbox.</p>

    <h2 class="my-8">Backup folder</h2>

    <p class="mt-8">By default, your backups will be stored in a folder called "Apps/Notion Backups/backups".</p>

    <p class="mt-8">Renaming individual backup files may prevent you from restoring your workspace from them.</p>

    <h2 class="my-8">Security</h2>

    <p class="mt-8">Dropbox integration doesn't have access to any other folders or files in your account except the contents of the "Apps/Notion Backups" folder.</p>

    <p class="mt-8">If you disconnect your Dropbox account from the dashboard, Notion Backups won't be able to access your account anymore (you can always reauthorize later). You can also revoke access from <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/account/connected_apps" class="underline" target="_blank" rel="noopener">your Dropbox account</a>.</p>

    <p class="my-8">Deleting your Notion Backups account will also revoke our access to your Dropbox account.</p>

    <p class="mt-8">If you have questions about Dropbox integration or anything else, feel free to <a href="/support.html" class="underline">reach out</a>.</p>
