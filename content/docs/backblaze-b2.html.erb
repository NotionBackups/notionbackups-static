      Setting up Backblaze B2
    </h1>

    <p class="mt-8">To back up your Notion workspace to Backblaze B2, connect Notion and add your B2 bucket details: key ID, application key, endpoint, bucket name, and optionally, a prefix.</p>

    <h2 class="my-8">Configuring bucket</h2>

    <p class="mt-8">To better protect your backups, set file visibility to private and enable <a href="https://www.backblaze.com/b2/docs/server_side_encryption.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="underline">server-side encryption</a> on your bucket.</p>

    <p class="mt-8">For data integrity, consider adding <a href="https://help.backblaze.com/hc/en-us/articles/360052973274-Object-Lock-FAQs" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="underline">Object Lock</a> to files in your bucket, but be wary of implications: locked objects can't be deleted until after they expire.</p>

    <h2 class="my-8">Generating application key</h2>

    <p class="mt-8">Once you have created your bucket, head over to the App Keys page and generate a new application key. Give it the least amount of permissions needed, namely:</p>

    <ul class="mt-8 text-xl text-gray-700 leading-8">
      <li class="mt-2">Restrict access to a single bucket only</li>
      <li class="mt-2">Do not allow <em>List Buckets</em> permission</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="my-8">Prefix</h2>

    <p class="mt-8">You can choose to organize your backups in a folder by specifying the prefix in the dashboard.</p>

    <h2 class="my-8">Access keys</h2>

    <p class="mt-8">The Key ID and Application Key are both encrypted at rest with an additional layer of encryption.</p>

    <p class="mt-8">The Application Key cannot be changed after creation.</p>
