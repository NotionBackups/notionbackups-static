    Backups
  </h1>

  <h2 class="my-8">Schedule</h2>

  <p class="mt-8">Your first backup should start soon after you add your Notion workspace and at least one cloud storage provider. If the backup file doesn't appear in your cloud storage within 24 hours, please <a href="mailto:support@notionbackups.com" class="underline">reach out</a>.</p>

  <p class="mt-8">By default, your workspace is backed up weekly, but you can change this frequency to daily or monthly in the workspace settings.</p>

  <h2 class="my-8">Pages</h2>

  <p class="mt-8">Notion Backups only backs up pages you have authorized. Pages created after authorization won't be backed up. You can review and choose which pages Notion Backups has access to in your workspace settings (it's a good idea to do it regularly).</p>

  <h2 class="my-8">Comments</h2>

  <p class="mt-8">If you connected your Notion workspace before <time datetime="2022-10-30">October 30th, 2022</time>, comments will not be backed up unless you have reauthorized your workspace after that date.</p>

  <h2 class="my-8">Media files</h2>

  <p class="mt-8">By default, media files uploaded directly to Notion (including images, audio, video, and PDF files) will be backed up. This can significantly increase your backup size. Note that only URLs for externally-hosted media files will be included in your backups, not the files themselves.</p>

  <p class="mt-8">You can disable the backing up of media files in your workspace settings.</p>

  <h2 class="my-8">Compression</h2>

  <p class="mt-8">Backups are compressed and archived in the zip file to reduce bandwidth and storage costs.</p>

  <p class="mt-8">If you have questions about anything, feel free to <a href="mailto:support@notionbackups.com" class="underline">reach out</a>.</p>
