      Refund Policy
    </h1>

    <p class="mt-8">Bad refund policies are infuriating. You feel like the company is just trying to rip you off. We never want our
    customers to feel that way, so our refund policy is simple: If you’re ever unhappy with our products for any reason,
    just contact <a href="mailto:support@notionbackups.com" class="underline">support@notionbackups.com</a> and we'll take care of you.</p>

    <h2 class="my-8">Examples of full refunds we’d grant.</h2>

    <p class="mt-8">Examples of full refunds we’d grant.</p>

    <ul class="mt-8 text-xl text-gray-700 leading-8 list-outside m-4">
      <li class="mt-2">If you were just charged for your next month of service but you meant to cancel, we’re happy to refund that extra charge.</li>
      <li class="mt-2">If you forgot to cancel your account a couple months ago and you haven’t used it since then, we’ll give you a full refund for a few back months. No problem.</li>
      <li class="mt-2">If you tried one of our products for a couple months and you just weren’t happy with it, you can have your money back.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="my-8">Examples of partial refunds or credits we’d grant.</h2>

    <ul class="mt-8 text-xl text-gray-700 leading-8 list-outside m-4">
      <li class="mt-2">If you forgot to cancel your account a year ago, and there’s been activity on your account since then, we’ll review your
      account usage and figure out a partial refund based on how many months you used it.</li>
      <li class="mt-2">If you upgraded your account a few months ago to a higher plan and kept using it in general but you didn’t end up using
      the extra features, projects, or storage space, we’d consider applying a prorated credit towards future months.</li>
      <li class="mt-2">If we had extended downtime (multiple hours in a day, or multiple days in a month) or you emailed customer service and
      it took multiple days to get back to you, we’d issue a partial credit to your account.</li>
    </ul>
