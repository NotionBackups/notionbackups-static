    Are Notion Pages Private by Default?
  </h1>

  <p class="mt-6 text-base text-gray-600 text-center">Updated: <time datetime="2023-10-03">October 3, 2023</time></p>

  <p class="mt-8">One common question among Notion users, especially those who are just getting started, is about the privacy settings of Notion pages. Let's break it down.</p>

  <p class="mt-8">First things first, when you create a new Notion page, by default, its visibility is set to private. This means that only you can view and edit the page. If you share the workspace with others, your page will be visible to the members of your workspace.</p>

  <h2 class="my-8">Can anyone outside of my workspace read Notion pages?</h2>

  <p class="mt-8">No, not unless you explicitly share or make the page public. By default, pages are private to you or the people within your workspace. However, Notion provides <a class="underline" href="https://www.notion.so/help/guides/understanding-notions-sharing-settings#different-ways-to-share-a-notion-page" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sharing options</a> that allow you to:

  <ul class="mt-8 text-xl text-gray-700 leading-8">
    <li>Making the page private, making it visible to you and you only</li>
    <li>Share the page with specific or all members of your workspace</li>
    <li>Create a public link that anyone with the link can view</li>
    <li>Make the page publicly searchable by search engines</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="mt-8">Always double-check the share settings of a particular page if you're unsure about its visibility.</p>

  <h2 class="mt-8">What's the difference between Teamspaces and Private?</h2>

  <p class="mt-8"><strong>Teamspaces</strong>: This is a shared space where multiple members can collaborate. Any page created within a teamspace can be viewed and edited by members of that teamspace, depending on the permissions set by the admin. It's ideal for collaborative projects, team notes, or any content that requires input from multiple members. Within a teamspace, you can still set specific pages or sub-pages as private, limiting access to specific members or just yourself.</p>

  <p class="mt-8"><strong>Private</strong>: A private page is only accessible to the individual who created it, unless it's specifically shared with others. Even within a teamspace, you can create private pages that are shielded from other members. Think of it as your personal corner within a bustling office â€“ your personal notes, drafts, or any information you're not ready (or don't need) to share.</p>

  <p class="mt-8">Furthermore, you can use <a class="underline" href="https://www.notion.so/help/guides/grant-access-teamspaces#use-custom-groups-to-adjust-permission-levels-for-multiple-people-at-once" target="_blank" rel="noopener">custom groups</a> to streamline management of page permissions and teamspace members.  Teamspaces and groups work together, allowing for precise control over content accessibility based on roles, teams, and company levels.Create groups based on departments or roles, and manage access to pages and teamspaces more efficiently.</p>

  <h2 class="mt-8">Making a Notion page publicly accessible by anyone</h2>

  <p class="mt-8">If you wish to share your Notion page with a wider audience, you can create a shareable link for public access.

  <p class="mt-8">Additionally, if you  are subscribed to a Plus plan, you can make your pages discoverable by search engines, which could be useful if you're creating public documentation, a portfolio, or any content that you want to be easily discoverable online.</p>

  <p class="mt-8">You can control who has access to your pages by setting <a class="underline" href="https://www.notion.so/help/sharing-and-permissions#how-to-edit-permissions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">different permission levels</a> such as <em>full access</em>, <em>can edit</em>, <em>can comment</em>, or <em>can view</em>. This way, you can easily grant the right level of access to different individuals or groups.</p>

  <h2 class="mt-8">Is it safe to store sensitive information in Notion?</h2>

  <p class="mt-8">While Notion provides robust sharing and permission settings, it's not end-to-end encrypted. Therefore, it's advisable not to store highly sensitive information, like personal identification numbers, confidential business data, or passwords, in Notion.</p>
