    Are Notion Pages Private by Default?
  </h1>

  <p class="mt-6 text-base text-gray-600 text-center">Updated: <time datetime="2023-09-30">September 30, 2023</time></p>

  <p class="mt-8">One common question among Notion users, especially those who are just getting started, is about the privacy settings of Notion pages. Let's break it down.</p>

  <h2 class="my-8">Are Notion pages private or public by default?</h2>

  <p class="mt-8">When you create a new Notion page, by default, its visibility is set to private. This means that only you can view and edit the page. Notion is designed with user privacy in mind, ensuring that your information is kept confidential unless you decide otherwise.</p>

  <h2 class="my-8">Can anyone outside of my workspace read Notion pages?</h2>

  <p class="mt-8">No, not unless you explicitly share or make the page public. By default, pages are private to you or the people within your workspace. However, Notion provides sharing options that allow you to:

  <ul class="mt-8 text-xl text-gray-700 leading-8">
    <li>Share the page with specific members of your workspace</li>
    <li>Create a public link that anyone with the link can view</li>
    <li>Make the page publicly searchable by search engines</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="mt-8">Always double-check the share settings of a particular page if you're unsure about its visibility.</p>

  <h2 class="mt-8">What's the difference between Teamspaces and Private?</h2>

  <p class="mt-8"><strong>Teamspaces</strong>: This is a shared space where multiple members can collaborate. Any page created within a teamspace can be viewed and edited by members of that teamspace, depending on the permissions set by the admin. It's ideal for collaborative projects, team notes, or any content that requires input from multiple members. Within a teamspace, you can still set specific pages or sub-pages as private, limiting access to specific members or just yourself.</p>

  <p class="mt-8"><strong>Private</strong>: A private page is only accessible to the individual who created it, unless it's specifically shared with others. Even within a teamspace, you can create private pages that are shielded from other members. Think of it as your personal corner within a bustling office â€“ your personal notes, drafts, or any information you're not ready (or don't need) to share.</p>

  <h2 class="mt-8">Making a Notion page publicly accessible by anyone</h2>

  <p class="mt-8">If you want your Notion page to be accessible to the broader public, in the sharing settings of a particular page, you'll find an option to create a shareable link. Once this link is generated, anyone with that link can view the page, even if they're not a Notion user.</p>

  <p class="mt-8">Furthermore, there's an option to make the page "Public on the web." By enabling this, your page becomes searchable and accessible via search engines like Google. This feature can be incredibly useful if you're creating public documentation, a portfolio, or any content that you want to be easily discoverable online. However, always exercise caution and ensure you're not inadvertently sharing sensitive or private information when making a page public.</p>

  <h2 class="mt-8">Is it safe to store sensitive information in Notion?</h2>

  <p class="mt-8">While Notion employs strong security measures to protect user data, it's essential to note that the platform isn't end-to-end encrypted. This means that while data is encrypted during transit and at rest, it can be decrypted by Notion under specific circumstances, such as for maintenance or if legally required. Because of this, it's not advisable to store highly sensitive information, like personal identification numbers, confidential business data, or passwords, in Notion. Always prioritize the security of your data by using platforms designed explicitly for sensitive information storage when needed.</p>
