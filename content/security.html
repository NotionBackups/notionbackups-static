<h2 class="my-8">Backups</h2>

<p class="mt-8">Your Notion data is only stored on our servers during the backup process; once the backup is complete, it is permanently deleted from our servers. To retain backups for the longer-term, you must connect to one of the available cloud storage providers.</p>

<h2 class="my-8">Cloud storage accounts</h2>

<p class="mt-8">Currently, you can store your backups in <a href="/docs/google-drive.html" class="underline">Google Drive</a>, Dropbox, and <a href="/docs/amazon-s3.html" class="underline">Amazon S3</a> buckets.</p>

<p class="mt-8">Google Drive and Dropbox integrations do not have access to any other folders or files in your account except the ones they have created. With Amazon S3, you can <a href="/docs/amazon-s3.html" class="underline">restrict your IAM user's access to specific buckets only</a>.</p>

<p class="mt-8">Disconnecting your Google Drive or Dropbox account revokes your access tokens, preventing Notion Backups from accessing your accounts in the future. Similarly, deleting your Notion Backups account automatically revokes access to your Google Drive and Dropbox accounts.</p>
